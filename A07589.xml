            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>SIR, J am sorry that I have not had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to know you sooner, and I wonder that you offer service to a person that is so unworthy of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mistrisse, it is the excellencie of your dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition which makes you speake so.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Excuse me Sir, for truth commands my tongue to use this phrase.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mistresse, I see so many noble and modest vertues expressed in your courtesie, as perswade
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:25086:4"/>my affectionate hope, that my intentions shall be acceptable, and that in time I may attaine to some thing in your good favour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir, if I had any good favour in me, it should be wholly at your dispose, but having none, you cannot hope for any.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mistrisse, you have so many gracefull beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that I should be most happy to possesse and to enjoy them. And I should be much preferred in my owne esteeme, if I had the favour to be affected by you, as much as I love and honour you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When I condiscend to your affection, it must be so well disposed, that it exceed not the termes of civill honestie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This it is which makes me honour you more deerely, and makes you still more lovely. And I beseech you to beleeve it, that my intentions have beene alwaies holy, and that I never ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med but at honest ends. What! did you thinke otherwise? and that I had pretended something that might be preiudiciall to your honour? no, I wish my heart may be deprived of life, before it shall give place to such a villanous designe: No, I intend for ever to continue your faithfull and most obedient servant, as mine indeavours shall expresse me in all occasions wherin I shall be employed by the honor of your commands.</p>

                     <hi>Sir, my affection shall be the pledge of that gratitude wherewith I thanke you for this and all your other undeserved favours; I am your humble servant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mistresse, it is I who am so much obliged to you, that I want all meanes to requite it, and therefore Mistresse I beseech you, and conjure you likewise, that I may obey you in all things where you shall thinke me capable to doe you service: in the interim after a thousand recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends, I humbly take my leave of you, leaving with you my heart for a pledge of my fidelitie and assured constancie.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>I hope to see you againe, and that ere long, if I may with your permission.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir, while your requests are civill, and your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions honest, you shal alwayes finde these dores open both to you and to your friends, who shall be ever welcome to the best entertainment that our poore abilities will permit, and therefore you may come at all times when please you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mistresse, I assure you that in going hence I deprive my selfe of a most faire day, to bee imprisoned in such horrible darkenesse as I know not to expresse. For I protest, that without you, I have neither day nor light,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:25086:5"/>and therefore the time of this sad absence will be so grievous to mee, that each moment will seeme an houre, each houre a day, and every day an age, if I be not cherished with my hope to bee in your good graces; and therewith I shall resolve to be patient:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>These are excessive phrases, but I hope you are not so passionate as you pretend. Farewell Sir, we shall see you some other time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mistresse, in this you both injure your own most excellent beautie, and my most faithfull affection; but I hope time shall give you a more perfect view both of mee and it, since necessitie doth now force mee to leave you: yet I shall never leave that affection which your faire eyes have cast upon my soule. Adieu sweet Mistresse till I see you againe, which shall be as soone as I can possibly.</p>

And assure your selfe, my dearest Mistresse, that you now behold a man that is intirely yours, and one that desireth not to live, except onely for your service. But that which breeds my greatest difficultie is, that I must be some while absent from you to dispose some affaires of great importance. And I beseech you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that wheresoever I shall goe, I shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies carry in my soule the lively image of your perfections, and that I shall not live, but by the Idea of your faire eyes, with a perfect resolution to obey you in all occasions: Adue sweet Mistresse till I see you againe, and I pray you excuse me that I can no longer wait of you.</p>

               <p>SIr, here is a Booke which I would present unto you, but I am ashamed to give you a thing of so small value, as is not worthy your acceptance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alas Sir! you indeare mee too much, you need not entertaine such feares, nor put your selfe to so much trouble; but I may very well be sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that I can never meet with a good occasion to returne your favours; I must intreat you ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to excuse my want of power, and to accept and use my service as a poore part of recompence and satisfaction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, doe not (I beseech you) refuse it because it is little, for (with all my heart) I wish it of a greater value, that then it might bee more proper to your merit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir, every publique action that is done so freely, should bee answered with some expression of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to those that honour us; but I that am not
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:25086:13"/>able at this present to returne you the like cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie, can onely thanke you for this booke, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to reade it often for your sake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, this is a trifle not worthy your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring, onely I beseech you to reckon me in the number of your friends, and of your humblest servants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir, I am yours most affectionately, and so I shall endevour to approve my selfe in all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons where you shall please to try me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We need not make tryall of the thing wee doubt not, and for my part I never distrusted the integritie of your affection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That which I said Sir, was onely to assure you of the good will J beare you, and not that I think you have any suspition of me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, I haue a long time knowne the sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of your intentions, and I beseech you to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse me, that this present is not correspondent to your merit, and that you will not reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the gift onely, but upon my good will and affection wherewith I offer it.</p>

                  <hi>Sir, what is it you desire of me, Sir? I am ready to do any thing that may content you, so that it do not exceed my power.</hi>

               <p>Sir, if it be not too troublesome, I shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire you to make my peace with M. N. for I know you are very powerfull with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir, you cannot trouble me in any thing in the world, and for this businesse I promise you that I will use my best indeavours to give you all the best satisfaction in it that possibly I can.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Deare friend, my forces are farre short of my desire, notwithstanding I will doe what lieth in mee (by GODS assistance) to attaine your purpose.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Yes very well Sir, but we neither live in that time nor place, nor is this businesse of that nature, and though he by his lingring did save his Countrey from that fearefull ruine which threatned it, yet there hath beene an in finite number who have lost whole kingdomes by negligent omitting of good opportunities. And this affaire being so different from that, both in it selfe, and in the qualitie of the persons, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth likewise another manner of proceeding.</p>

                  <hi>It is soone enough, if well enough, I will go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it immediatly, I meane, to speake with your

               <p>Sir, I never doubted your good will to mee, and therefore I give you many thankes, and I promise you that my intire affection shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver faile you in any thing where I am capable to doe you service.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir, let us leave this discourse I pray you, for I cannot doe any thing that may deserve that value, but I shall still remaine more obliged to you for your regard, having done me the honour to come to my poore house, and afford me the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of your good companie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, I see well by your accounts, that you are not a good Arithmetician, excuse me Sir, I pray you, for speaking in this manner, for it is I that have this honour, and I should desire to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:25086:26"/>enjoy it longer, were it not that my affaires call for my attendance in another place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir, being I cannot goe with you any further, by reason of these Gentlemen which expect my companie, I beseech you to excuse mee, and take it in good part that my Man wait of you to your lodging. Ho</hi> N. <hi>heare you, goe and wait of this Gentleman to his lodging, and doe not leave him till you see him there, and faile not to salute my Cosen his wife in my name, and tell her, I send her a good night, wishing humble recommends.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>In that Sir, I shall agree with you, for J bought him for a good one, his head indeed is not amisse, and he carries it well enough, he hath a good foot, and a cleane legge, a good eye, a good haire, a good docke, and that well and long, and to exceed all this, he is well breathed: and such as he is Sir, he is at your dispose.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sir, you know a friend is another selfe, and therefore we ought to have mutuall respects one to another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, make triall of me when you please, and you shall alwayes finde a congruitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene

                  <hi>Sir, it is a thing J never doubted, and of my part J assure you of the like, for J may boldly sweare that there is not a man in the whole world hath so much power with me as your selfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir I thanke you for it, I shall take the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to come and visit you very often, and to see how you do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir you will oblige me very much, and when you do so, J shall say you are my friend indeed.</hi>

               <p>Sir I shall not faile, and so I take my leave of you, because I have a little businesse. Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well Sir, I am wholly yours.</p>

               <head>A Discourse of Exercises.</head>
               <p>SIr, I pray you tell mee what is your daily exercise, and I shall tell you mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir, I want none, for from eight in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, till ten, I ride the great horse, and after dinner, I use to exercise my weapons. But how doe you bestow your time?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I learne to danee, and to play upon the Lute, and I learne French also.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir, I beleeve your exercises are much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santer then mine, but in the meane time they are not so usefull nor so profitable, being they serve onely for a particular contentment, but mine are usefull both in publique and in private occasions in case of necessitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You say right Sir, but men of peace doe not desire warre.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nay Sir, it is not that J preferre warre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:25086:28"/>peace, but yet it is good to be provided with defensive weapons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is true Sir, but in the meane time it is not fit for every man to take up armes, for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is better to suffer patiently, then to be too sudden in revenge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir, that you speake is very true, but who observes it: that tenet is now out of request, which commands us to turne our right cheeke when we are strooke upon the left.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I beleeve it well, that for your part you cannot doe it, for you are too hastie, yet this is the holy Scripture, and I would wish you to consider, wee doe not want examples of it; yet wee must not relye upon examples onely, but chiefly upon Gods Commandements.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alas Sir, there are very few now a daies, that thinke of it, and if you should speake thus in some places, they would take you for a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That's true, but for all that, it is fit that armes should have their limits as well as other things. A Magistrate may use them to Gods honour,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:25086:29"/>and the King service: But private men being allowed to weare them, must not abuse them, nor you must not be offended with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is no part of my intention, for I know this proceeds of your good nature, which wisheth no hurt to any one, and what we speake, is but in the way of sport and merriment.</hi>

               <head>To comfort a friend after the death of some Kinsman.</head>
               <p>SIr, I desire not to renue your griefe, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to open those wounds which bleed inwardly alreadie in your heart, for this were an inhumane act, rather then the office of a friend, but the cause of my comming is to let you see the just ressentment that I have of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>N.</hi> your Cousins death, and I sweare to you, that troubles me as much as if it were the nearest of mine owne alliance, for you know wee were alwaies very intimate and familiar friends.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir, his bloud could not deny him, hee was the best of all my kindred, hee ever beheld mee with a friendly regard, and hee was a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to me when hee found me afflicted and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in minde, besides the other favours and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistances which I received daily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This indeed I confesse Sir may justly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease our sorrow, but yet wee have reason
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:25086:30"/>to be glad and praise God in this respect, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hee dyed a good Christian, and after hee was well prepared for his last conflict, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it often happens, that the most assured finde many difficulties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is true Sir, yet in the meane time, you see his Wife hath a great charge of children, and but little meanes to maintaine them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, what desire you more? God will bee their especiall protector, and hee never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets his charge, and you likewise for your part will not abandon them, as I assure my selfe in that opinion which I have of your good nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir, I know very well that I can expect nothing by it but charge and trouble, but that which grieves me, is his absence, and to finde my selfe deprived of his pleasant and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar conversation, doth incessantly afflict my minde.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:25086:30"/>
               <p> Sir, I will agree with you that it is a matter of great difficultie, and almost impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible suddenly to take away the impressions of such a just ressentment. Yet in the end wee must resolve with holy <hi>Iob</hi> to bee pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, saying, God hath given, and God hath taken away, his Name bee praised; and since one may doe thus, this is the best way, for all the teares in the world cannot prevaile with death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir, it is easie to give comfort to another, when wee our selves are not sensible of the evill, but when wee are to take it, then it is hard of digestion, especially in such accidents as this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, it cannot bee prevented, and yet you know it is better to dye once for all, then to dye a thousand times by a living kinde of death: to lye a long time sicke in bed, languishing of some painefull and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous maladie, as wee see many that in the end are compelled to dye after suffering a thousand deaths.</p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:25086:31"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>But Sir, if it had pleased God to let him live but five or sixe yeeres longer, he had laid a good foundation to establish his house, and to provide for the preferment of his children, which are now exposed to the incertaine favours of those friends which shall take charge of them, and I feare that those who have most cause, will bee least carefull to provide for them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, in such cases as this, where there is no remedy, wee may say as the great Patriarch <hi>Abraham</hi> said to his sonne <hi>Isaac,</hi> God will provide; briefly Sir, you are wise and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet enough to apprehend such comfort as you thinke most fit. And so I defire your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to goe and take order for the dispatch of an important businesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir, I give you many thankes for your paines, and for your friendly visite, whereby I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived great comfort: please you to drinke?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:25086:31"/>
               <p> Sir, I thanke you with all my heart, it needs not at this time, take comfort in God alone, and you shall see that he will dry up all teares, which might bee tollerable in a woman or a childe, but in a man of your qualitie, I can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver approve it; excuse mee Sir I pray you. Adieu.</p>
